# Road Accident Prediction and Prevention AI System

This project provides a multi-agent AI-based solution to predict, prevent, and respond to road accidents. The solution analyzes historical road crash data, traffic patterns, and environmental conditions to identify crash hotspots, generate executive briefs, recommend preventative measures, and propose policy guidelines to improve road safety for all users.

## Features

- **Crash Hotspot Identification**: Predict high-risk areas for road accidents using machine learning and geospatial data.
- **Executive Brief Generation**: Summarize key findings, insights, and recommendations in a concise and actionable format.
- **Preventative Measure Suggestions**: Recommend infrastructure changes and traffic management measures to prevent future accidents.
- **Policy Guidelines Recommendations**: Offer creative public policy solutions like improved signage, traffic signal timing, and public awareness campaigns.
- **Geospatial Visualization**: Visualize crash hotspots on an interactive map using Folium.
